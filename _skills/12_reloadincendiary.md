Reload your rifle with <font color='#FF1500'>incendiary</font> <font color='#00EFFF'>Ammunition</font>. <br> <font color='#FF1500'>Incendiary</font> Ammo deals additional fire damage and ignites enemies. <br>
                          Targets killed with <font color='#FF1500'>incendiary</font> Ammunition equipped will errupt in a flaming explosion, dealing heavy fire damage around in a small area.
