<p style="font-size: large;">Tired of boring Bow-and-Arrow-Gameplay? Feel uninspired by always jumping to high ground and simply using the strongest skill currently off cooldown?
Do you enjoy the smell of gunpowder and the satisfying recoil provided by firearms? Then the Musketeer Classmod might just be the mod for you.
<br><br>
D:OS2 is a great game that encourages players to strategize and solve problems with creative solutions and ideas. Whilst <font color='#FF1500'>Pyromancers</font> 
or <font color="#a0aad3">Assasins</font> have a diverse arsenal of skills at their disposal, <font color="#16eb07">Rangers</font> are left with very little creativity
in their toolkit. The Mod was designed with a new Class in mind, the <font color="#efbd16">Musketeer</font> that uses firearms to deal heavy ranged-DPS but require
more finesse to unleash their high damage potential.
<br><br>
Firearms need to be reloaded when empty and can be loaded with different kinds of <font color="#00efff">Ammunition</font>. In order to clearly show the player his available <font color="#00efff">Ammunition</font> and currently loaded <font color="#00efff">Ammunition</font>-Type, 
a new Menu, the <font color="#00efff">Ammobar</font> will be available once a firearm is equipped. The <font color="#00efff">Ammobar</font> shows the current and maximum <font color="#00efff">Ammunition</font> 
of a player's current firearms and also preview the consumption and restoration of <font color="#00efff">Ammunition</font> a skill would provide.<br>

<br><br>
The currently loaded <font color="#00efff">Ammunition</font>-Type is also displayed by a pulsating effect on the top part of the Menu.<br>

The Musketeer Mod does not replace any game content and only adds more options. If your friends still fancy primitve bows and arrows, then let them be.
Rifles are a new Weapon-type and not a direct replacement for bows or crossbows.
